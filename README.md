# Vignesh's Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio page, where you can get to know more about me!

Currently the site is a Flask web server running inside a DigitalOcean VPS. By utilizing Docker Compose to run and manage multiple containers along with an NGINX reverse proxy, I have also integrated a link shortener into the site, more specifically [cli_shortener](https://github.com/vigneshsk17/cli_shortener)
